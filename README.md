## What is this?
Behind the massive concrete walls of City Hall, electricity flows in patterns that tell a story. This dashboard decodes those patterns into three main views:

- **Seasonal Shifts**: How the building battles the New England summer heat.
- **Weekly Rhythms**: The clear difference between the busy workweek and quiet weekends.
- **Daily Heartbeat**: A 24-hour profile of the building "waking up" and settling down.

## Features
- Interactive charts with monthly, weekly, and hourly energy patterns
- Real-time peak and average power demand metrics
- Dark theme UI with responsive design
- Analyzes 100,000+ data points from 15-minute intervals

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 & CSS Grid
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Chart.js

This was a fun project to explore data storytelling. I used AI to help with my understanding and to refine the implementation.
