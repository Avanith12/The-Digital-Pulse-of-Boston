                This interactive energy dashboard transforms over 100,000 data points from Boston's open datasets into a
                cinematic narrative.
                By decoding 15-minute electricity intervals, it reveals the seasonal, weekly, and hourly "digital pulse"
                of one of the city's
                most iconic public structures.

            <h2>A City's Silent Rhythm</h2>
            <p>
                Behind the heavy concrete walls of Boston City Hall, a silent conversation is happening. Every 15
                minutes,
                the building speaks in numbers kilowatts of demand that trace the arrival of workers, the humming of air
                conditioners, and the deep breaths of a structure that never truly sleeps.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Boston moves toward a greener future, these numbers are more than just utility costs. They are a map
                of our habits, showing us where we are efficient and where we leave the lights on for no one.

                By decoding over 100,000 data points from the City's open records, we can see the building's
                "heartbeat."
                The patterns are not just random spikes; they tell the story of the seasons and the workweek.

                        year.
                        The significant peaks in <strong>July and August</strong> represent the building's massive
                        cooling requirements during Boston's humid summers.
                        A smaller secondary rise in the winter months reflects the energy needed to keep systems running
                        against the cold.

                        The high plateau from <strong>Monday to Friday</strong> matches standard city hall hours, while
                        the noticeable dip on
                        <strong>Saturday and Sunday</strong> shows the building entering a lower-power state when staff

                        Power peaks around <strong>2:00 PM</strong>. Crucially, notice that the "Baseline" at 3:00 AM

                        this is the constant energy cost of keeping a modern city hall "alive."

            <h2>Toward a Transparent Future</h2>
            <p>
                Data is the first step toward change. By making the invisible energy of our public buildings visible,
                we empower every citizen to ask: "Can we do better?" Boston City Hall is a monument of the past,
                but its energy data is a blueprint for our future.
